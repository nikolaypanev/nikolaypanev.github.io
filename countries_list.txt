I have a list of the following countries:
- Kuwait
- Oman
- Malaysia
- Nepal
- Cyprus
- Hungary
- Croatia
- Serbia
- Ghana
- Bangladesh
- Sri Lanka

My client wants a visual representation of this list. He wants every country to be represented on a card. 
The card contains the country borders, which are filled with the country flag, and on the bottom there is 
a skyline representation of popular country landmarks. The image I uploaded is an example of what I just described.

Create a card like that for every country on that list
